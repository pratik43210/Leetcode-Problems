*Step 1: Initial Setup*
The algorithm begins by initializing key variables. n stores the length of the height array, total is used to accumulate the total amount of trapped water, and lmax and rmax keep track of the running maximum heights from the left and right sides. Two pointers, l and r, are initialized to point to the start and end of the height array, respectively.
​
*Step 2: Two-Pointer Traversal*
The algorithm enters a while loop, which continues until the two pointers, l and r, meet. The idea is to process the smaller height between the left (height[l]) and right (height[r]), moving the pointer with the smaller value inward. This allows us to determine the amount of water trapped above each bar without needing to precompute maximum heights on both sides.
​
*Step 3: Left Pointer Processing*
If height[l] <= height[r], the algorithm processes the left side of the array. If height[l] is greater than or equal to the current lmax, it updates lmax to the new value, as no water can be trapped above this bar. However, if height[l] is smaller than lmax, water can be trapped at this position. The amount of water trapped is equal to lmax - height[l], which is added to total. After processing, the left pointer l is incremented to move inward.
​
*Step 4: Right Pointer Processing*
If height[l] > height[r], the algorithm processes the right side. The logic here is symmetrical to the left pointer processing. If height[r] is greater than or equal to rmax, rmax is updated to the new value. Otherwise, if height[r] is smaller than rmax, water is trapped above the current bar, and the trapped amount is rmax - height[r], which is added to total. After processing, the right pointer r is decremented to move inward.
​
*Final Step: Returning the Result*
Once the loop ends (i.e., when the two pointers meet), the variable total holds the total amount of water trapped, and the function returns this value.
​
*Time and Space Complexity*
*Time Complexity*: The algorithm runs in O(n) because each element of the array is processed once as the two pointers move inward. The time complexity is linear.
*Space Complexity*: The space complexity is O(1) because no extra arrays or data structures are used, making it more efficient than the previous solution in terms of memory.
This two-pointer approach efficiently calculates the trapped water by simultaneously tracking maximum heights from both directions and moving inward.
